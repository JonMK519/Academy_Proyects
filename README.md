## 🎯 Key Metrics Explained

### ROI (Return on Investment)
```
ROI = (Total Return - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment × 100%
```
Positive ROI indicates profitable investment.

### NPV (Net Present Value)
```
NPV = Σ (Cash Flow_t / (1 + Discount Rate)^t)
```
Positive NPV means the project creates value.

### Payback Period
Time required to recover the initial investment through cash flows.

### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
The discount rate that makes NPV = 0. Compare with your required rate of return.
