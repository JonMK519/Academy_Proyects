## Usage Examples

### Example 1: High-Quality Business Case

**Project Name:**

- Score: 100/100 ✓
- Feedback: "Excellent: Clear and professional name"

**Problem/Opportunity:**
"Currently, our customer support team invests 10 hours weekly in manually classifying incoming support tickets, generating an average 4-hour delay in first response to customers. This delay contributes to a 15% customer dissatisfaction rate and represents an operational cost of 40 hours-man per month, equivalent to $8,000 in labor costs."
- Score: 100/100 ✓
- Feedback: "Excellent: Well-defined problem with quantifiable impact"

**Overall Score: 43-50/100** (with 2 fields completed)

### Example 2: Needs Improvement
